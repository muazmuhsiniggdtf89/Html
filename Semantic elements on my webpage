                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>The water cycle, also known as the hydrological cycle, describes the continuous movement of water on, above, and below the surface of the Earth.</p>
           
           
                <h3>Key Processes</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Evaporation:</strong> The sun heats up water in rivers, lakes, and oceans, turning it into water vapor that rises into the air.</li>
                    <li><strong>Condensation:</strong> As the water vapor rises, it cools and turns back into liquid water droplets, forming clouds.</li>
                    <li><strong>Precipitation:</strong> When the water droplets in clouds become too heavy, they fall back to Earth as rain, snow, sleet, or hail.</li>
                    <li><strong>Collection:</strong> The precipitation collects in bodies of water like rivers, lakes, and oceans. It can also seep into the ground, replenishing groundwater supplies.</li>
                    <li><strong>Transpiration:</strong> Plants absorb water through their roots and release water vapor into the air from their leaves.</li>
                </ul>
            
            
                <h3>Importance of the Water Cycle</h3>
                <p>The water cycle is crucial for sustaining life on Earth, regulating climate, and renewing freshwater supplies.</p>
